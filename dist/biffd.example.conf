# A config directive is of the form:
# MATCH_KEY:MATCH_VALUE:COMMAND
# where MATCH_KEY is the name of an environment variable (usually one set by biffd).
# If the value of the specified env variable equals MATCH_VALUE, then COMMAND is executed.

# While MATCH_KEY can be any environment variable, the following are created and made available by biffd:
# MAIL_FROM: the email sender as given in the SMTP 'MAIL FROM'
# MAIL_TO: the email recipient as given in the SMTP 'RCPT TO'
# MAIL_HEADER_*: Every header from the email, including SUBJECT, DATE, TO, etc. The header name will be uppercased and prepended with 'MAIL_HEADER', eg 'Date' -> 'MAIL_HEADER_DATE'

## EXAMPLES
# If an email comes from foo@bar.com, append the email's subject to a file
#MAIL_FROM:foo@bar.com:echo "${MAIL_HEADER_SUBJECT}" >> foo_subjects.txt
# If an email is addressed to uniquekey123@self.local, copy all image attachments to a timestamped directory
#MAIL_TO:uniquekey123@self.local:DIR="/example/dated-files/$(date +%s)"; mkdir -p "$DIR"; find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.jpg' -o '*.jpeg' \) -exec cp --no-preserve=all -t "$DIR" "{}" \;
